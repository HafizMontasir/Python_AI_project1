Given our results, the "best" model architecture is VGG. It outperformed both of the other architectures when considering both objectives 1 and 2. You will notice that ResNet did classify dog breeds better than AlexNet, but only VGG and AlexNet were able to classify "dogs" and "not-a-dog" at 100% accuracy. The model VGG was the one that was able to classify "dogs" and "not-a-dog" with 100% accuracy and had the best performance regarding breed classification with 93.3% accuracy.

Project Objectives Met:
1. Identifying Dogs vs Non-Dogs: VGG and AlexNet achieved 100% accuracy, while ResNet achieved 90% for non-dogs and 100% for dogs
2. Classifying Dog Breeds: VGG performed best with 93.3% accuracy, followed by ResNet (90.0%) and AlexNet (80.0%)

Model Run Times:
ResNet: 12 seconds
AlexNet: 7 seconds
VGG: 44 seconds
